# SANS-SEC505
The SEC505-Scripts.zip file contains some of the lab files for my SANS Institute course [SEC505: Securing Windows and PowerShell Automation](https://sans.org/sec505).

Most of these same scripts are in repositories here, but the zip has a folder structure that matches more closely the USB flash drive given to SEC505 course attendees.  Virtually all the scripts are intended for teaching purposes, they're not intended to be production-quality tools yet, hence the lack of Pester tests, input validation, exception handling, logging, etc.

All of the scripts and files written by me have the 0BSD license, but other files may have their own separate licenses, which they retain of course.  

For more information about my six-day course on Windows security and PowerShell at SANS, please visit https://sans.org/sec505.  

Hope to see you at SANS!
